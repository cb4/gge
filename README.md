# gloomhaven-digital-savegame-editor
Python code to edit your Gloomhaven Digital savegame. Run the SaveGameEditor.ipynb notebook in Jupyter to get started.

Note that in order to change the personal quest deck, you need to install a package called `netfleece`. This package doesn't run correctly in Python 3.9 and above, so please create a Python 3.8 environment for this.
